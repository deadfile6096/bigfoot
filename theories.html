            <p class="theories-description">After decades of research and hundreds of verified sightings, our network has developed several theories about the true nature of the entity known as "Bigfoot." The following information is compiled from classified documents, insider testimonies, and our own field research.</p>

                        <p>Evidence suggests that Bigfoot may be the result of a classified DARPA genetic engineering program initiated in the late 1960s. The program, codenamed "TITAN STRIDE," aimed to create enhanced reconnaissance agents capable of surviving in extreme wilderness conditions without support.</p>

                            <li>Declassified budget documents from 1967-1974 show over $2.1 billion allocated to an unspecified "Anthropomorphic Field Asset Development" program</li>
                            <li>Multiple ex-military personnel have testified about facilities in remote areas of the Pacific Northwest that were conducting "primate enhancement" experiments</li>
                            <li>The pattern of sightings correlates strongly with the locations of known DARPA testing grounds</li>
                            <li>Hair samples have shown evidence of artificial genetic modifications to primate DNA</li>

                        <p>Our research indicates that at least 17 "subjects" escaped from containment facilities, with possible breeding occurring in the decades since. Government agencies actively monitor these populations while publicly denying their existence.</p>
